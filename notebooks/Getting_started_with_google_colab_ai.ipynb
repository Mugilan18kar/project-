We are launching public preview for a simple and intuitive Python library (google.colab.ai) to access state-of-the-art language models directly within Colab environments. All users have free access to most popular LLMs, while paid users have access to a wider selection of models. This means users can spend less time on configuration and set up and more time bringing their ideas to life. With just a few lines of code, you can now perform a variety of tasks:\n",
